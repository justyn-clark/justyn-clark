## About

I design and build execution-first systems at the intersection of software, AI, and media.

Founder of **Justyn Clark Network (JCN)** - a development studio focused on deterministic systems, auditability, and long-term maintainability over hype-driven abstraction.

My work typically centers on:
- protocol-driven execution models
- schema-first platforms and workflows
- AI systems with explicit governance and constraints
- audio, video, and media infrastructure
- developer tooling and CLIs

## Current Projects

These are active, evolving systems - not experiments or archived ideas.

- **SMALL Protocol**  
  A formal execution protocol for AI-assisted work.  
  Makes work resumable, auditable, and deterministic using file-based, Git-native artifacts.  
  Tool-agnostic. Agent-safe. Boring by design.

- **Spindle**  
  A Go-based CLI for orchestrating structured execution loops ("Ralph loops") across agents, tasks, and environments.  
  Designed to run, resume, and audit real work - not just prompt chains.

- **Schema Foundry**  
  A growing catalog of high-signal domain schemas and system patterns for real products.  
  Focused on durable architecture, not framework churn.

- **ClientBrief**  
  An intake and briefing platform for clients, media, and structured requirements.  
  Combines schema-driven forms, file ingestion, and AI-assisted normalization.

- **Mindrail**  
  A constrained AI reasoning and routing layer focused on execution safety, not creativity theater.  
  Built to support governed workflows and bounded inference.

- **PHOS**  
  Media and processing infrastructure for audio and video pipelines.  
  Focused on durability, metadata integrity, and production workflows.

- **Thread-Based Engineering (TBE)**  
  A system design and execution methodology for running architecture review and implementation in parallel.  
  Emphasizes traceability, concurrency, and clear handoff boundaries.

## Featured Repositories

Public repos focus on protocols, tooling, and patterns that are stable enough to share.

## Activity

Most work happens in active product repositories and private systems.  
Public code reflects execution models, templates, and tooling that survive real-world use.
