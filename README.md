## About

I design and build execution-first systems at the intersection of software, AI, and media.

Founder of **Justyn Clark Network (JCN)** - a development studio focused on systems that value clarity, determinism, and durability over hype and abstraction.

My work typically centers on:
- execution models that survive interruptions
- schema-first platforms that scale cleanly
- AI systems with real constraints
- audio, video, and media pipelines
- developer tooling that does real work

## Current Projects

These are active, evolving systems - not experiments or shelfware.

🛠️ [SMALL Protocol](https://github.com/justyn-clark/small-protocol) (Public) - A shared language for making work traceable, resumable, and verifiable. Think "source control for execution state."

🎧 **[JustBeatz Music](https://justbeatzmusic.com)** (closed-source) - A full-stack music platform focused on audio playback, media storage, and metadata management. 

🔄 **[loopexec](https://loopexec.dev)**  (closed-source) - A CLI for running bounded execution loops without losing context or progress. Designed to keep work moving forward, even when everything else stops.  

三 **[musketeer](https://musketeer.dev)** (closed-source) - A command-line companion for running coordinated work across multiple agents and tools. Built for alignment, guardrails, and keeping execution pointed in the same direction.  

🛠️ **Schema Foundry** (closed-source) - A curated collection of schemas and system blueprints pulled from real products. Less theory. More things that actually ship.

💼 **ClientBrief** (closed-source) - A structured intake system for turning messy ideas into usable inputs. Designed for clients, teams, and creative workflows that need clarity fast.

🧠 **Mindrail** (closed-source) - A safety rail for AI-assisted work. Keeps reasoning constrained, routed, and grounded in reality.

🎇 **PHOS** (closed-source) - A media utility layer for generating and managing visual assets. Built for consistency, reuse, and production-grade outputs.

🧵 **Thread-Based Engineering (TBE)** (closed-source) - A way to design and build systems in parallel without losing the thread. Focused on handoffs, traceability, and sane collaboration.

## Activity

Most work happens in active product repositories and private systems.  
Public code reflects ideas that survived contact with reality.
