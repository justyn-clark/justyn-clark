## About

I design and build execution-first systems at the intersection of software, AI, and media.

Founder of **Justyn Clark Network (JCN)** - a development studio focused on systems that value clarity, determinism, and durability over hype and abstraction.

My work typically centers on:
- execution models that survive interruptions
- schema-first platforms that scale cleanly
- AI systems with real constraints
- audio, video, and media pipelines
- developer tooling that does real work

## Current Projects

These are active, evolving systems - not experiments or shelfware.

- **SMALL Protocol**  
  A shared language for making work traceable, resumable, and verifiable.  
  Think “source control for execution state.”  
  https://smallprotocol.dev

- **Musketeer**  
  A command-line companion for running coordinated work across multiple agents and tools.  
  Built for alignment, guardrails, and keeping execution pointed in the same direction.  
  https://musketeer.dev

- **loopexec**  
  A CLI for running bounded execution loops without losing context or progress.  
  Designed to keep work moving forward, even when everything else stops.

- **Schema Foundry**  
  A curated collection of schemas and system blueprints pulled from real products.  
  Less theory. More things that actually ship.

- **ClientBrief**  
  A structured intake system for turning messy ideas into usable inputs.  
  Designed for clients, teams, and creative workflows that need clarity fast.

- **Mindrail**  
  A safety rail for AI-assisted work.  
  Keeps reasoning constrained, routed, and grounded in reality.

- **PHOS**  
  A media utility layer for generating and managing visual assets.  
  Built for consistency, reuse, and production-grade outputs.

- **Thread-Based Engineering (TBE)**  
  A way to design and build systems in parallel without losing the thread.  
  Focused on handoffs, traceability, and sane collaboration.

## Activity

Most work happens in active product repositories and private systems.  
Public code reflects ideas that survived contact with reality.
