## About

I design and build execution-first platforms at the intersection of software, AI, and media.

Founder of **Justyn Clark Network (JCN)** - a development studio focused on systems that prioritize determinism, auditability, and long-term maintainability over hype.

My work commonly involves:
- schema-driven backends and workflows
- CMS and automation tooling
- AI-enabled systems constrained by real-world governance
- audio and video infrastructure

## Activity

Most work happens in active product repos and private systems. Public repositories reflect tooling, templates, and protocols that are stable enough to share.
